7.  Server out of sync
    How Useful ?
    Can show when the server started going out of sync.
    Can estimate / try to figure out if it is related to network issue or Load or anything else.
    If it is Load, can try to pull the top CPU time consumers from system load monitor.
    Log files to check:
        tipsdb.log
        tips-londiste.log
        tips-pgqadm.log

        system load monitor
        postgresql logs

8.  CleanUP issues:
    platform.log

9.  Failed to fetch software updates etc

    extSync.log -- can only show the errors

10.  mdm

    Can show errors.
    Can filter out entire logs for one poll to mdm server. (Start of the poll to end of the poll)
    Log format may vary based on what mdm we are using. Have to think about this.
